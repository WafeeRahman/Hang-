<h1>Hang: A Result of Exploring Web Development</h1>
Introduction
Hang is a fullstack CRUD web application that I started to make after taking a summer course on Udemy. It's heavily inspired by the knowledge and skills I acquired during this course, with the aim of creating a platform for discovering and sharing hangout spots.

<h2>Tech Stack</h2>
Hang is built on a robust tech stack that reflects the tools and technologies I mastered during my exploration of web development: 
<br>

<strong>Mongoose:</strong> <br> Leveraging Mongoose as an Object Data Modeling (ODM) library allowed me to efficiently interact with the MongoDB database.

<strong>Node.js:</strong> <br> Node.js served as the foundation, enabling me to create server-side scripts and work within an event-driven architecture.

<strong>Express:</strong> <br> I harnessed Express to build a robust web application with scalable APIs.

<strong>MongoDB:</strong> <br> MongoDB became the backbone for storing data, offering the flexibility required to handle spot information.

<strong>MapBox:</strong> <br> The integration of MapBox enhanced the user experience by providing interactive map controls for exploring hangout spots.

<strong>Bootstrap5 and EJS Mate:</strong> <br> These front-end technologies ensured a visually appealing and consistent user interface.

<strong>Cloudinary and Multer:</strong> <br> The incorporation of Cloudinary and Multer added image upload functionality, enhancing the platform's dynamic capabilities.

<strong>PassportJS:</strong> <br> PassportJS added an essential layer of security through basic authentication, ensuring that only authorized users can access specific features.

<strong>Helmet Middleware:</strong> <br> The use of Helmet middleware fortified security by implementing protective HTTP headers and addressing potential vulnerabilities.

<strong>JOI Schemas and Validation:</strong> <br> To maintain data accuracy and prevent malicious inputs, I employed JOI schemas and validation.

<strong>Starability .CSS:</strong> <br> Starability .CSS provided an intuitive star rating system for user reviews.

<h3>Key Features</h3>


<h4>Discover and Share Hangout Spots</h4>
Hang enables users to discover exciting hangout spots and share their favorite locations. The project allows users to create, view, update, and delete spot listings, fostering a community of spot enthusiasts.

<h4>Reviews</h4>
User reviews play a crucial role in Hang. The project includes a one-to-many relationship data model for reviews, enabling users to share their experiences and insights with the community.

<h4>Secure Authentication</h4>
Security is a priority in Hang. I implemented basic authentication through PassportJS, ensuring that user data remains safe and only authorized users can access specific features.

<h4>Interactive Maps</h4>
Thanks to MapBox integration, users can explore hangout spots on interactive maps, enhancing the overall user experience.

<h4>Image Upload</h4>
Hang incorporates Cloudinary and Multer middleware, allowing users to upload images when creating new spots or editing existing ones. This feature makes the platform more dynamic and engaging.

<h4>Error Handling and Validation</h4>
To maintain a smooth user experience and data integrity, the project includes JOI schemas and validation, along with comprehensive error handling.

<h4>Conclusion</h4>
Hang is the practical application of my newly acquired skills and knowledge I gained during the summer. I'm glad I was able to implement a lot of features and develop my knowledge past that of a regular Sophomore student in University. Now, I'm looking into web development using REACT and the next project will most likely use REACT.
